 Just like real-world dictionaries, Swift's dictionaries are used to associate a key with a value. The key can be anything, although it is usually a String. Likewise, the value can be anything you want to associate with the key.
 To demonstrate, let's recreate a real-world dictionary using a Swift dictionary. We won't do the entire dictionary, since that would take a long time; instead, we'll just demonstrate Swift's dictionaries by making a dictionary that consists of some interesting words.
 Here's a cool word: rigmarole. Let that one roll off the tongue a few times. Here's the definition of rigmarole: "a lengthy and complicated procedure." Not at all like learning about Swift's dictionaries!
 How would you represent this very basic dictionary in Swift code?
 Here's how to declare a Dictionary variable in Swift and populate it with the definition of rigmarole:
 
 */
 
var practiceDictionary = ["rigmarole": "a lengthy and complicated procedure"]
 
/*
 Probably looks a bit like an Array definition, doesn't it? Can you spot the difference?
 Notice that this definition contains a colon (:). A Dictionary definition in Swift looks a lot like an Array definition, except you define both the key and its related value, separated by :.
 The syntax looks similar because a Dictionary shares a lot of similarities with Arrays. They both are lists of items, the difference being that a Dictionary associates one item with another. Remember how Arrays had to contain the same type of data? An Array of Strings could not contain an Int, for exampleâ€”all the items had to be Strings.
 Dictionaries have similar limits. In a Dictionary, all of the keys have to be the same type, and all of the values have to be the same type. Keys need not be the same type as values, though. For example, keys could be Ints and values could be Strings, and that would be fine.
